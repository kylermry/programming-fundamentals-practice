1.) Create a new folder called recipe-exercises and add a file called script.js inside of it (using the mkdir and touch commands).

2.) Write out a function definition called marinaraSauce(). Be sure to be mindful of your syntax!

3.) nside this function, write a series of console.log(); statements that will print the following marinara sauce recipe:
- Heat a medium-large saucepan over medium heat.

- Add 2 tspns of oil and 5 carlic cloves, cook until golden, about 2 minutes

- Add 1/4 cup water, 2 cans of crushed tomates, and salt and season with black pepper to taste.

- Cover the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low, and simmer until the sauce is heated, about 10 minutes

- Stir in 1/4 cup roughly chopped fresh basil, salt and pepper as needed.


4.) After your function definition, write the line of code that will invoke your function

5.) Run your script with node script.js. You should see your recipe printed to the screen!

Part 2. Using Parameters

1.) In your function definition, change marinaraSauce() to take one parameter called cookName.

2.)Use cookName to print "Hey, cookName! This is my marinara sauce recipe!" before the recipe.

3.) Change your function invocation to take "Adam" as a cookName

4.) When you run your script, you should see "Hey, Adam! This is my marinara sauce recipe!", followed by the recipe.

Part 3 Using Variables

1.)A the top of your function definition, define a variable called two, and assign it the number value 2.


2.)  Use string concatenation (i.e. the "+" sign) to replace any instance of 2 or 1/4 that occurs in the recipe.
